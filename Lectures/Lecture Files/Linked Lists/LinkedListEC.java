/**
 * EC +5 points each
 * 1. 	  
 * 		public boolean deleteHere(String target)
 * 		Finds and deletes the first node containing the target item
 * 		and returns true if item deleted or false if item is not
 * 		in the list.
 *    
 * 2.	public void outputListRec()
 * 		-Ñprints the list from first to last using recursion.
 *  	Hint: The basic idea is that you print the first item in the list then do a recursive 
 *  	call to print the rest of the list. This means you need to keep track of what hasn't been 
 *  	printed yet (the "rest" of the list). In particular, your recursive method needs to know 
 *  	where the first item is. Note that printRec() has no parameter so you need to use a helper 
 *  	method that does most of the work. It should have a parameter that lets it know where the 
 *  	part of the list to be printed starts.  
 *
 * 3.	public void outputListRecBackwards()
 * 		-Ñprints the list from last to first using recursion. Hint: Printing backward recursively 
 * 		is just like printing forward recursively except you print the rest of the list before printing 
 * 		this element.
