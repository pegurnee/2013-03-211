TURN SEQUENCE:
(1)	Player must roll the dice. Each hex marked with the number rolled produces ONE(1) resource
	card for each adjacent settlement and TWO(2) resource cards for each adjacent city.
	If a SEVEN(7) is rolled, the robber is moved by the current player to a new hex. (see THE ROBBER)
(2)	Player may trade resources with a harbor that they own or the bank. 
	Trades: 
		3:1 Harbor: Player may trade THREE(3) of any ONE(1) resource for ONE(1)
		of their choice.
		2:1 Harbor: Player may trade TWO(2) of any ONE(1) resource for ONE(1) of
		their choice.

RULES FOR BUILDING ROADS AND SETTLEMENTS:
***Each player only has FIVE(5) cities, FOUR(4) settlements, and 15 roads.***
Roads:  built on the edges between two hexes
	Current player can only build a road if it connects to one of their
	properties or another of their own roads.
Settlements: 	built on the intersections of three hexes.
		CANNOT be built on an intersection adjacent to another settlement.
Cities:	replace existing settlements.

THE ROBBER:
If a player rolls a seven, the following actions are taken:
(1)	Any player with more than seven cards must discard half of their cards,
	rounding down.
	Example: Player 1 has 9 cards when a 7 is rolled and must discard 4.
(2)	The player who rolled the 7 moves the robber to any other land hex.
	While the robber is on a hex, that hex does NOT produce resources even
	if its number is rolled.
(3)	The player who rolled the 7 steals one resource card from a player with
	a village adjacent to the robber hex.
	*******Neither part 1 nor part 3 are capable of working in this version*******
